## Week 2 report ##

I started coding the huffman coding, only to realize i know nothing about compression, nor working with bits with Java.
This is likely my main problem in the begininning.
I managed to write down couple classes and simple testing untility. However i do think that i need to a whole lot of reworking as i need to change the string handling to bit handling.
I also started to work on file input class, but at the same time realized, that it might be just better to use standard in and standard out to move the files around. This is since i have no plans to create any kind of user interface for my compression program, but instead just use command line.

I spent also some time on **LZ compression** This will is likely to get painful in upcoming weeks as all the presentations, *read: "youtube videos"* seem bit confusing and not directly about compressing or decompressing files.

During this week i think i spent about 20 hours on this project. Time was mostly spent on trying to figure out what i should do and how to approach it.

***********

In the next week i need to change my huffman implementation to use bits as input and output. I also need to start documentation and do a lot of googling how to set up the jacoco for test.
