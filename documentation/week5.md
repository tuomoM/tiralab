# Week 5 of strife
-------
The plague of file interface kept me in darkness for most of the time this week. I rewrote the entire huffman to make it bit more clear, unfortunately rendering the tests non usable.
The problem with byte interfacing is that the operators are so cryptic that they are hard to understand and small changes in them cause the whole cardhouse to crumble.

The deadline of getting this working is looming. The treadfull conclusion is likely that this little piece of shit is not going to work.

This week i spent about 20 hours working on this project.

## next week
------

*there is still a diminishing hope that i will manage to complete the huffman next week.*
Should a miracle happen and file interface would start working, **i could give LZ a try.**

I am assuming this pitiful project is barely if at all able to get through this course.
