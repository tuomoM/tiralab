##Project defenition##
Target of the project is to implement compression methods using Java. Initial target is to implement hoffman coding.
As test data i will use text file containing first chapter of Moby Dick.
I will test character level hoffman and for comparison implement a version of lz compression.

Compression should achieve result between 60% - 30% reduction in file size.
