## Project defenition ##
Target of the project is to implement compression methods using Java. Initial target is to implement hoffman coding. After the huffman is working the LZW will be tackled.
As test data i will use text file containing first chapter of Moby Dick.
I will test character level hoffman and for comparison implement a version of lz compression.
****

Compression should achieve result between 60% - 30% reduction in file size.
